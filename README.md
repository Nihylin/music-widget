got bored of dealing with third party plugins and linking my accounts with shady apps who got their heads stuck too deep in capitals ass (sidenote lol no I don't want to pay 5$ a month to have a shitty "custom" music widget made with a drag & drop wysiwyg editor this trash should be free you capitalist pig)

thanks nutty :)
